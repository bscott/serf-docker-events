serf-docker-events
==================

Control a cluster of Docker servers by using Serf to build/pull/push/run/stop Docker images.

Designed to work with [octohost](https://github.com/octohost/octohost).

Updated for my [Sysadvent 2013 Article](https://github.com/darron/sysadvent-docker)

Deprecated: Works with the Packer template at [darron/packer-ubuntu-13.10-docker-serf](https://github.com/darron/packer-ubuntu-13.10-docker-serf).
